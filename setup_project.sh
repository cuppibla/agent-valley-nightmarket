# The Night Market — make a fresh billing-linked Google Cloud project for week five.
#
# Run this FIRST, before ./setup_codelab.sh. It leaves you with:
#   • a project that exists, is billing-linked, and is old enough to serve
#   • that project ID in ~/project_id.txt
#   • that project set as gcloud's active project
#
# A NEW PROJECT IS THE DEFAULT. Week five starts clean even when you already
# have a project sitting in ~/project_id.txt or in your project list. That file
# is the single thing every earlier lab writes to, so whatever is in it is as
# likely to belong to some other codelab as to weeks one to four — reusing
# it silently drops week five's resources into a stranger's project, and the
# script cannot ask you which one you meant. Making a project is cheap and
# unambiguous, so that is what happens unless you say otherwise.
#
# Set AGENT_VALLEY_REUSE_PROJECT=1 to reuse instead: the script then takes the
# project in ~/project_id.txt, or scans for one shaped like the earlier weeks'
# agent-valley-NNNN, and only creates something if neither turns up.
#
# NOT safe to re-run blind: a second plain run makes a second project. Re-run
# with AGENT_VALLEY_REUSE_PROJECT=1 to pick up where the last one left off —
# every error message below tells you this too.
#
# It never prompts. Every failure exits non-zero with a fix to try.
